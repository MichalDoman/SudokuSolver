# SudokuSolver

### About project:
This app was made with the aim of incorporating programming into my own hobbies. Since I always liked Sudoku, the moment I started programming I had in mind a project, similar to this.

This Sudoku Solver requires inserting initial digits of a Sudoku puzzle. 
Then solves it using 11 different techniques, which require identifying a specific
arrangements, that are:
1. singles
2. pairs
3. triples
4. hidden singles
5. hidden pairs
6. hidden triples
7. pointing pairs
8. pointing triples
9. x-wing
10. y-wing
11. swordfish

The solving process starts with the most basic techniques. However, if they make no advancement on the board, more complicated algorithms come into play.

### Plans for future development:
1. Measuring time that was taken for the algorithms to solve the puzzle.
2. Adding an option to see every step that the Solver took with the name of technique used.
